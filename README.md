#### Features

- **Auto-read**: Articles are automatically marked as read when switching feeds (`s`/`a`) or exiting (`q`)
- **Unread focus**: Only unread articles can be navigated with `j`/`k`. Read articles are automatically excluded from the list
- **Feed priority display**: Feeds with unread articles are displayed at the top for efficient checking
- **Background browser**: Browser focus is maintained in terminal when opening with `v` key
- **Pin function**: Articles can be pinned for later reading with `p` key, and pinned articles can be opened in browser (max 10 at once) with `o` key. Articles are opened in oldest-first order and pins are automatically removed after opening. Press `o` key multiple times to open the next 10 articles. Pins are removed for successfully opened URLs even if some URLs fail to open
- **Favorite and pin synchronization**: Adding to favorites with `f` key automatically sets pins. Removing from favorites also removes pins (v0.4.0+)
- **Favorites list view**: Switch to dedicated single-pane view for favorite articles with `Shift+F` key. Article scrolling, pinning, and favorite removal operations are available

### CLI Commands (For Management)

#### Getting Started

First, try the **tutorial mode** to experience the features:

```bash
termfeed tutorial
```

#### Feed Management

```bash
# Add RSS feed
termfeed add <RSS_URL>

# Example: Add Hatena Bookmark popular entries
termfeed add https://b.hatena.ne.jp/hotentry.rss

# Delete feed
termfeed rm <FEED_ID>

# Display feed list (with IDs, grouped by rating sections)
termfeed list

# Check feed list in export format
termfeed export -  # Display to stdout
```

#### Article Reading

**Use TUI mode (`termfeed tui`).**
TUI provides interactive features like reading unread articles, favorites management, opening in browser, and feed rating.

##### Feed Rating Function
- Set feed importance with `0`-`5` keys (0=no rating, 5=highest rating)
- Feeds are displayed in sections by rating, sorted by high rating first
- Only the section containing the currently selected feed is expanded
- Unread article count is displayed for each section, optimizing information density

#### Feed Updates

Feeds can be updated using the following methods:

- **TUI mode**: After launching `termfeed tui`, press `r` key to update all feeds
- **MCP server**: Use `update_all_feeds` tool

TUI allows real-time monitoring of update status and immediate reading of new articles.


#### Feed Export/Import

```bash
# Export feeds in OPML format (default)
termfeed export
# -> Output to subscriptions.opml

# Export with specified filename
termfeed export my-feeds.opml

# Export in text format (one URL per line)
termfeed export feeds.txt --format text

# Auto-detect from extension (.txt ‚Üí text format)
termfeed export feeds.txt

# Import from OPML file
termfeed import subscriptions.opml

# Import from text file (one URL per line)
termfeed import feeds.txt

# Explicitly specify format
termfeed import feeds.xml --format opml
```

**Supported formats:**
- **OPML format**: Standard format for data migration between RSS readers (.opml, .xml)
- **Text format**: Simple one-URL-per-line format. Supports comment lines (starting with #)

### MCP Server (AI Agent Integration)

termfeed can operate as an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server, allowing AI agents like Claude Code to access article data.

#### Starting MCP Server

```bash
# Start as MCP server (stdio communication)
termfeed mcp-server
```

#### Usage with Claude Code

Register as MCP server in Claude Code:

```bash
# Register development version (specify repository path)
claude mcp add --scope user termfeed -- npx tsx /path/to/termfeed/src/index.ts mcp-server

# Register built/installed version
claude mcp add --scope user termfeed -- termfeed mcp-server
```

#### Available Resources

You can access termfeed data within Claude Code as follows:

**Resources (data reading):**
```
@termfeed:articles://unread          # 10 unread articles (default)
@termfeed:articles://favorites       # 10 favorite articles
```

**Tools (operation execution):**
- `update_all_feeds`: Update all feeds and retrieve new articles
- `get_article`: Get individual article details (full text) by specifying article ID

**Tool usage example:**
```
get_article(id: 123)  # Get details of article ID 123
```

**Note:** Individual article retrieval is implemented as a tool rather than a resource to improve discoverability in Claude Code.

#### Usage Examples

Natural language query examples in Claude Code:

- "Summarize unread articles in termfeed"
- "Analyze trends from favorite articles"
- "Tell me about the content of article ID 456"

#### MCP Benefits

- **Real-time**: Instant access to latest article data
- **Structured**: Detailed information including metadata in JSON format
- **Secure**: Local communication only, no external APIs
- **Efficient**: Dynamic retrieval of only necessary data

### Database Location

SQLite database is created by default at `~/.local/share/termfeed/termfeed.db` (XDG Base Directory compliant).
You can change the location with the `TERMFEED_DB` environment variable:

```bash
export TERMFEED_DB=/path/to/your/termfeed.db
```
