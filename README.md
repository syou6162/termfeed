- **Priority feed display**: Feeds with unread articles are shown at the top for efficient checking
- **Background browser**: `v` key opens browser while maintaining terminal focus
- **Pin feature**: `p` key pins articles for later reading, `o` key opens up to 10 pinned articles in browser.

### CLI Commands (Management)

#### Getting Started

First, try the **tutorial mode** to experience the features:

```bash
termfeed tutorial
```

#### Feed Management

```bash
# Add RSS feed
termfeed add <RSS_URL>

# Example: Add Hatena Bookmark popular entries
termfeed add https://b.hatena.ne.jp/hotentry.rss

# Remove feed
termfeed rm <FEED_ID>

# List feeds (with IDs, grouped by rating sections)
termfeed list

# Check feed list in export format
termfeed export -  # Display to stdout
```

#### Article Reading

**Use TUI mode (`termfeed tui`).**
TUI provides interactive features including unread article browsing, favorite management, browser opening, and feed rating.

##### Feed Rating Feature
- Set feed importance with `0`-`5` keys (0=no rating, 5=highest rating)
- Feeds are displayed in rating sections, sorted by highest rating first
- Only the section containing the currently selected feed is expanded
- Unread article counts are displayed for each section, optimizing information density

#### Feed Updates

Feeds can be updated through the following methods:

- **TUI mode**: After launching `termfeed tui`, press `r` key to update all feeds
- **MCP server**: Use `update_all_feeds` tool

TUI allows real-time monitoring of update status and immediate viewing of new articles.

#### Feed Export/Import

```bash
# Export feeds in OPML format (default)
termfeed export
# -> outputs to subscriptions.opml

# Export with specified filename
termfeed export my-feeds.opml

# Export in text format (one URL per line)
termfeed export feeds.txt --format text

# Auto-detect from extension (.txt ‚Üí text format)
termfeed export feeds.txt

# Import from OPML file
termfeed import subscriptions.opml

# Import from text file (one URL per line)
termfeed import feeds.txt

# Explicitly specify format
termfeed import feeds.xml --format opml
```

**Supported formats:**
- **OPML format**: Standard format for data migration between RSS readers (.opml, .xml)
- **Text format**: Simple one-URL-per-line format. Supports comment lines (starting with #)

### MCP Server (AI Agent Integration)

termfeed operates as an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server, allowing AI agents like Claude Code to access article data.

#### Starting MCP Server

```bash
# Start as MCP server (stdio communication)
termfeed mcp-server
```

#### Usage with Claude Code

Register as MCP server in Claude Code:

```bash
# Register development version (specify repository path)
claude mcp add --scope user termfeed -- npx tsx /path/to/termfeed/src/index.ts mcp-server

# Register built/installed version
claude mcp add --scope user termfeed -- termfeed mcp-server
```

#### Available Resources

Access termfeed data in Claude Code as follows:

**Resources (data reading):**
```
@termfeed:articles://unread          # 10 unread articles (default)
@termfeed:articles://favorites       # 10 favorite articles
```

**Tools (operation execution):**
- `update_all_feeds`: Update all feeds and fetch new articles
- `get_article`: Get detailed article content (full text) by article ID

**Tool usage example:**
```
get_article(id: 123)  # Get details for article ID 123
```

**Note:** Individual article retrieval is implemented as a tool rather than a resource to improve discoverability in Claude Code.

#### Usage Examples

Natural language query examples in Claude Code:

- "Summarize unread articles from termfeed"
- "Analyze trends from favorite articles"
- "Tell me about article ID 456"

#### MCP Benefits

- **Real-time**: Instant access to latest article data
- **Structured**: Detailed information in JSON format including metadata
- **Secure**: Local communication only, no external APIs
- **Efficient**: Dynamic retrieval of only needed data

### Database Location

SQLite database is created by default at `~/.local/share/termfeed/termfeed.db` (XDG Base Directory compliant).
You can change the location with the `TERMFEED_DB` environment variable:

```bash
export TERMFEED_DB=/path/to/your/termfeed.db
```
